# Metadesc

## General
This extension adds an old-fashioned meta-description based on the Open-Graph meta-desc, which Pagekit provides. The Open-Graph meta-description is used by Facebook and many more, but not by all crawlers.

**This project will no longer be maintained.**

## Installation
Please install this extension via Pagekit's marketplace

## Configuration
There is no configuration necessary - just install it. If you do not want to use it, just disable and, if you do not want to use it later, remove it from your installation.
